# git-basics
This is where I store my notes on the simple commands on how to use git and github

git pull                    #get updates from the remote origin


git add -A                  #add all the updates you have made   #after updating files locally

git commit -m "I did XYZ"   #commit the changes and add a message to explain what you did

git push                    #send cimmitted changes to the remote origin
